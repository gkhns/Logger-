Challenge Description

A client reported that a PC might have been infected, as it's running slow. We've collected all the evidence from the suspect workstation, and found a suspicious trace of USB traffic. Can you identify the compromised data?

Given: PCAP file

As the first step, we open the PCAP file in Wireshark:

* Capture File Properties --> Elapsed Time --> 55 seconds
* Protocol Hierarchy --> 100% USB traffic and 18.9% Text Items
